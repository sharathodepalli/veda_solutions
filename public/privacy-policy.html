      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-primary-900 mt-8 mb-4">4. How We Handle Protected Health Information (PHI) - HIPAA Compliance</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        **If and to the extent Vedha Solutions receives, uses, or discloses Protected Health Information (PHI) in connection with the Services provided to our Covered Entity clients, we do so solely as a Business Associate under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and its implementing regulations.**
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li>We enter into a **Business Associate Agreement (BAA)** with each Covered Entity client, outlining our respective responsibilities for protecting PHI.</li>

        <li>We implement appropriate **administrative, physical, and technical safeguards** to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of PHI, as required by the HIPAA Security Rule.</li>
        <li>We will report any security incidents or breaches of unsecured PHI to our Covered Entity clients as required by HIPAA's Breach Notification Rule.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-4 p-4 rounded-xl bg-red-50 border border-red-200 text-red-700">
        <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This Privacy Policy is a general statement. Specific obligations regarding PHI are governed by the Business Associate Agreements we establish with our clients. Patients seeking to exercise their rights regarding PHI should contact their healthcare provider (the Covered Entity) directly.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-primary-900 mt-8 mb-4">5. Sharing Your Information</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may share your Personal Information with third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf (e.g., hosting, analytics, customer support, email delivery). These providers are contractually obligated to protect your information and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Compliance and Protection:</strong> We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) comply with a legal obligation, (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Vedha Solutions, (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Services or the public, or (d) protect against legal liability.</li>
        <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction.</li>

      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-primary-900 mt-8 mb-4">6. Data Security</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        We implement robust and commercially reasonable security measures designed to protect your Personal Information and PHI from unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction. This includes encryption, access controls, regular security assessments, and employee training. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-primary-900 mt-8 mb-4">7. Data Retention</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        We retain your Personal Information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. The retention periods for PHI are governed by our Business Associate Agreements and applicable healthcare regulations.
